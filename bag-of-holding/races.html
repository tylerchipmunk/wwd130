               <h3>Dwarfs</h3>
               <p>Dwarfs are hearty creatures. They are known for being excellent craftsmen of metal and stone. While short they live to be over 400 years and tend to hold on to tradition firmly. If you don’t like to beat around the bush and would rather face a problem head on, this might be a race to consider. </p>

               <h3>Elves</h3>
               <p>Slender and agile, Elves are one of the most beautiful rases. They love knowledge and are more often curious than greedy. While they live to be 700 years old, Elves can hold a grudge and don’t often forget friends or enemies. If you believe the world reconvenes around you, this race could be the one for you.</p>

               <h3>Dragonborn</h3>
               <p>Hatched from the eggs of dragons long ago, Dragonborn are a more human vision of their reptilian ancestors; though, they lack the wings. Many Dragonborn worship full dragons and some serve them. Many fear Dragonborn out of misunderstanding for their fierce features. If you have ever wanted to play as a dragon, this is the best bet for full filling that dream.</p>

               <h3>Half-Orc</h3>
               <p>While many find these behemoths unattractive, Half-Orcs stand as one of the tallest and strongest. They also are one of the most emotional beings. Anger burns like acid in their veins, sadness drains all of their energy and their laughter is hearty and full. If talking isn’t your thing and you’d rather brawl it out rather than argue, here’s the race for you.</p>

               <h3>Tiefling</h3>
               <p>Having the blood of an ancient and powerful evil being running through your veins has its upsides, but as a Tiefling you will always be looked down on by general society. Walking through public roads will almost undoubtedly bring stares, whispers and shouted insults. Many chose to embrace the wild blood in them but other fight back and do great good in the world.  If you have ever wanted to be an outcast turned hero, now is your chance.</p>
