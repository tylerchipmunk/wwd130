        Who and why will they visit my site
People will come to my site because they are looking for help creating a character before their first Dungeons and Dragons session. They will want help knowing what race and class best fits their play style. While they can find this information elsewhere, they will turn to my site because I will provide brief summaries and comments on typical play stile for each class and race. 
Website organization details
The race page will contain a description of common characteristics possessed by each race along with any important game statistics. On the Class page the classes will be separated by general play style and then further distinguished by the innuendos of each. The following is a rough draft transcript for each of the descriptions.

      <h3>Races</h3>
      <p>
        Races
1.	Dwarf
a.	Dwarfs are hearty creatures. They are known for being excellent craftsmen of metal and stone. While short they live to be over 400 years and tend to hold on to tradition firmly. If you don’t like to beat around the bush and would rather face a problem head on, this might be a race to consider. 
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As a Dwarf you will gain a +2 bonus to your Constitution score
ii.	You will also get a +1 bonus to either your Wisdom or Strength score (It’s your choice)
iii.	You will be slightly slower than other, taller, races
iv.	You will be able to see in the dark for 60 feet 
2.	Elf
a.	Slender and agile, Elves are one of the most beautiful rases. They love knowledge and are more often curious than greedy. While they live to be 700 years old, Elves can hold a grudge and don’t often forget friends or enemies. If you believe the world reconvenes around you, this race could be the one for you.
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As an Elf you get a +2 bonus to your Dexterity score
ii.	You will also get a +1 bonus to either your Intelligence or Wisdom score (It’s your choice)
iii.	You can see in the dark for 60 feet
iv.	It is more difficult to surprise you and you don’t need to sleep
3.	Human
a.	This is what you are. With tons of diversity, a human can equally fulfill any roll in an adventuring party. They usually make up the majority of the world’s population in most settings. If you are looking for a Jack of all trades look no further! 
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As a Human you will gain a +1 bonus to all of your base scores
ii.	You can chose another language to speek
4.	Dragonborn
a.	Hatched from the eggs of dragons long ago, Dragonborn are a more human vision of their reptilian ancestors; though, they lack the wings wings. Many Dragonborn worship full dragons and some serve them. Many fear Dragonborn out of misunderstanding for their fierce features. If you have ever wanted to play as a dragon, this is the best bet for full filling that dream.
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As a Dragonborn you will gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score
ii.	Your Charisma score also gets a +1 bonus
iii.	You have a breath weapon of the same element that you descend from. You might be a Red Dragon decedent so you breath fire or a Blue Dragon and you breath lightning. 
iv.	You are resistant to the type of damage delt by your breath weapon 
5.	Half-Orc
a.	While many find these behemoths unattractive, Half-Orcs stand as one of the tallest and strongest. They also are one of the most emotional beings. Anger burns like acid in their veins, sadness drains all of their energy and their laughter is hearty and full. If talking isn’t your thing and you’d rather brawl it out rather than argue, here’s the race for you.
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As a Half-Orc you will gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score
ii.	Your Constitution score also gets a +1 bonus
iii.	You can see in the dark for up to 60 feet.
iv.	Your best attacks do extra damage.
6.	Tiefling
a.	Having the blood of an ancient and powerful evil being running through your veins has its upsides, but as a Tiefling you will always be looked down on by general society. Walking through public roads will almost undoubtedly bring stares, whispers and shouted insults. Many chose to embrace the wild blood in them but other fight back and do great good in the world.  If you have ever wanted to be an outcast turned hero, now is your chance.
b.	Noteworthy statistics:
i.	As a Tiefling you will gain a +2 bonus to your Charisma score
ii.	Your Intelligence score also gets a +1 bonus
iii.	You can see in the dark for up to 60 feet.
iv.	Fire doesn’t harm you as much as it should

      <h3>Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Classes
1.	Mele fighters
a.	Barbarian
i.	Built to smash, Barbarians aren’t usually very smart. While they don’t usually have too much armor, they have more than enough health to make up for it.
b.	Fighter
i.	The Fighter has trained all his/her life with weapons and can use special maneuvers to gain the upper hand in combat. Heavily armored and with a moderate heath pool, this is a go too starter class.
c.	Monk
i.	As deadly with their fists as they are with a sword, Monks are the martial artists of the world. They learn to focus their soul, their Ki, to stretch the physical boundaries of their bodies.
d.	Paladin
i.	Holy warriors that use heavy armor and the blessings of the divine to vanquish their foes. While they have access to the magic of the celestials, it isn’t very strong so don’t expect to be able to heal others too much.
e.	Ranger
i.	The Nomads and Hunters turned hero of the world usually become Rangers. They focus on a specific favored terrain and foe gaining advantages when faced with a challenge related to one of them. They are usually lightly to moderately armored and have a moderate heath pool. They also can earn the companionship of a beast they find during their travels. 
f.	Rogue
i.	Keeping to the shadows a Rogue is deadly while unseen, But due to its light armor and small health pool a direct one on one combat with almost any other class would surly be a death sentence. 
2.	Damage spell casters
a.	Druid
i.	Protectors of nature, Druids draw their magic from the land. Refusing to use metal armor they usually stick to light leather armor for protection. Their specialty magic allows them to transform themselves into animals for a limited time.
b.	Sorcerer
i.	A Sorcerer is born magic. This can be the result of a pact made by your ancestors with a dragon long ago or the forces of pure magic in the world when you were born. Their magic is often focused on controlling the elements.
c.	Warlock
i.	If you make a deal with a verry powerful being to get magic powers, you are a Warlock. That being is now your patron. While you can’t cast as many spells as the other spell casters, you get other fun gifts from your patron and access to a very powerful attack spell that you can cast whenever you want.
d.	Wizard
i.	The nerds of the magic world, Wizards study the arcane and learn words of magic to be able to cast their spells. They definitely have access to the most and most widely diverse range of spells. They can also cast more but they are the squishiest class with only light armor and almost no health to speak of.
3.	Support
a.	Bard
i.	The Bard is the band/theater kid who decided to go on an adventure. Their words and music inspire their allies to do better while their insults could literally kill their enemies.
b.	Cleric
i.	The other holy warrior on this list is the Cleric. The Cleric however, while still a formidable mele foe, is not as well armored and has less health than the Paladin. A clerics job is to call down the powers of the celestials to burn evil to a crisp and heal the good.
