    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this web site is to provide pertinent information to the users by organizing the goods and services sold by White Water Adventures into easy to access groups and providing links to other pages with more in detail information. These products should be available to all; This page would provide global and 24/7 access to our company. I would also like to have a page dedicated to describing the history and back story of White Water Adventures as a company would allow the general public to familiarize themselves with our company mission and goals. It would contain the contact information for White Water Adventures to provide to the public ease of communication. The site will also provide a place for past costumers to leave reviews and experiences. I hope that providing this opportunity will allow those more hesitant to purchase the product to have something as close to a vicarious experience as we can provide, hopefully quelling any fears or concerns. Upon purchase of a service or product the website should have the added functionality of collecting costumer's contact information and allowing them to either download safety and release of liability forms to print or to fill out directly on the website. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The expected user and average client of this web site would typically be between the ages of 16 and 45. This would place them old enough to have a job an have some income. An average work day would most likely be a typical 9 to 5 day. Some of the costumers and projected visitors to the site would be in school as well. But a common thread to all of these is that they are all available over the weekends to go adventuring. Each of these people of families would enjoy an adventure down a lake. They may enjoy the out doors and seeing nature, being on the water and feeling it's flow or maybe the are just seeking the thrill of something new. Many of them would be lacking engagement and excitement in their life, many others would be seeking a connection to the earth, but all of them feel a void inside them created by their monotonous weekly lives. As a busy father or mother, the client may access the site from a desktop at home or work. An occupied college student would probably find the website while surfing the web on their lap top or in a library. The young teen would most likely use their mobile device to find and book an adventure for them and their friends.</p>
